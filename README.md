# K-Means_Clustering_GUI
This repository contains a Python implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm with a graphical user interface (GUI). The program allows users to input the number of clusters (K) and initial centroids through the GUI, visualizes the clustering results using Matplotlib, and displays the final centroids and assigned elements.
