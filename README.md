# K-Means_Clustering_GUI
This repository contains a Python implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm with a graphical user interface (GUI). The program allows users to input the number of clusters (K) and initial centroids through the GUI, visualizes the clustering results using Matplotlib, and displays the final centroids and assigned elements.

## Features:
Interactive GUI: Input K and initial centroids through a user-friendly interface.
K-Means Algorithm: Implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm for grouping data points.
Results Display: Final centroids and assigned elements are displayed with up to four decimal places.
Data Visualization: Clustering results are visualized using Matplotlib for easy interpretation.

## Usage:
Run the program.
Input the desired number of clusters (K) and initial centroids via the GUI.
View the final centroids and assigned elements in the GUI.
Visualize the clustering results in a Matplotlib scatter plot.
